 README: Regression Models with Linear, Polynomial, and SVR

 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of   Linear Regression  ,   Polynomial Regression  , and   Support Vector Regression (SVR)   
to predict data trends. The models are built using Python libraries like `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`, 
with visualizations to compare model performance. The project is ideal for predictive analytics, data analysis, and machine learning education.

 Key Features

-   Linear Regression  : Predicts target values assuming a linear relationship with input features.
-   Polynomial Regression  : Extends linear regression to model non-linear relationships by using polynomial transformations.
-   Support Vector Regression (SVR)  : Models non-linear relationships using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.

 Use Cases

-   Predictive Analytics  : Forecast sales, stock prices, and other trends.
-   Data Analysis  : Analyze relationships between variables.
-   Machine Learning Education  : Learn how to implement basic regression models.
-   Business Intelligence  : Build predictive tools for decision-making.
-   Scientific Research  : Analyze trends in scientific datasets.

 Future Use in AI & ML

 AWS SageMaker Integration:
-   Scalable Training  : Train models on large datasets using AWS SageMaker.
-   Hyperparameter Tuning  : Optimize model parameters with SageMaker's automatic tuning.
-   Real-Time Inference  : Deploy models for real-time predictions at scale.

 Benefits:
- Handle large datasets and perform advanced ML tasks.
- Use SageMaker to automate model deployment and monitor performance.
